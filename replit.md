# Overview

This is an intelligent algorithmic trading system that combines a React frontend with an Express.js backend to provide real-time market analysis and automated trading capabilities. The application implements multiple trading strategies including trend following, mean reversion, arbitrage detection, and market timing to generate trading signals and execute orders through broker APIs. It features a comprehensive dashboard with live data visualization, portfolio management, performance analytics, and real-time trading signals.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The UI layer leverages shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for consistent styling and accessibility. The application uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing and TanStack Query for efficient server state management with automatic caching and background refetching.

The frontend implements a real-time dashboard that displays market data, portfolio positions, trading signals, and performance analytics. WebSocket connections provide live updates for market data changes, signal generation, and order status updates. The styling system uses Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for a dark-themed trading interface optimized for financial data visualization.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built on Express.js with TypeScript, implementing a RESTful API architecture. The application uses an in-memory storage system (MemStorage) that implements a standardized IStorage interface, allowing for easy migration to persistent database solutions. The backend provides WebSocket support for real-time communication with connected clients.

The API layer includes endpoints for portfolio management, order execution, strategy management, signal generation, and market data retrieval. The server implements comprehensive logging middleware and error handling to ensure reliable operation during live trading scenarios.

## Data Management
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema definitions for structured data modeling. Database tables include users, portfolios, positions, orders, strategies, signals, and market data with proper foreign key relationships. The schema supports decimal precision for financial calculations and includes timestamp tracking for audit trails.

Market data is managed through a combination of real-time feeds and historical storage, with technical indicators calculated on-demand using custom algorithms for RSI, MACD, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands.

## Trading Strategy Engine
The system implements multiple algorithmic trading strategies:
- **Trend Following**: Uses moving averages, MACD, and breakout detection
- **Mean Reversion**: Employs statistical analysis with Z-scores and Bollinger Bands
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Monitors price disparities across exchanges
- **Market Timing**: Combines technical indicators with pattern recognition

Each strategy generates confidence-weighted signals that can trigger automated order execution based on predefined risk parameters.

## Real-time Communication
WebSocket integration provides bidirectional communication between clients and server for:
- Live market data updates
- Trading signal notifications
- Order status changes
- Portfolio performance updates

The WebSocket implementation includes automatic reconnection logic and proper error handling for production reliability.
