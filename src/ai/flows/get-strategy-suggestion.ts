Stock: {{{stockSymbol}}}
Trading Strategy: {{{strategy}}}

Historical Data:
{{{historicalData}}}

Your task is to analyze the recent trends in the provided data in the context of the selected strategy.
- For "Trend Following", look for established upward or downward trends.
- For "Mean Reversion", identify if the stock price has deviated significantly from its recent average.
- For "Market Timing", consider broader market indicators, although the data is for a single stock, so focus on volatility and volume as proxies.
- For "Arbitrage", this strategy is not applicable to a single stock's historical data, so state that and recommend 'Hold'.

Provide a concise reasoning for your final suggestion.`,
